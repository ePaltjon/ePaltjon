## **ðŸ¤µ About Me**  
######
  Hello there! I'm Ethan Paltjon and I am an **aspiring data scientist** who is currently pursuing a B.A. in Data Science at Harding University.  
  
  My current programming languages (as of July 2023) include:  
  
  * C++
  * Python
  * Microsoft Excel
  * Microsoft Access

  Outside of data science, I am deeply passionate about finance and have taken numerous courses to explore my interest, including Managerial Finance, Financial and Managerial Accounting, Personal Finance, and Macroeconomics. Furthermore, I have experience co-managing a $35,000 portfolio and turning an initial $17,000 loss into a $2,000 profit over the span of a few months.
  
  I am looking to **combine my interests in data science and finance** by leveraging advanced statistical techniques and revolutionary computational methods to derive key financial insights and optimize long-term corporate investments.
